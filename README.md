### The Feminization of Tech

A few weeks back, Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire founder and CEO of Meta, was quoted on the Joe Rogan podcast saying that corporate America has been "feminized" - and that the tech industry needs to embrace a masculinized energy once more. I admire his confidence in saying so, because in my own experience, he could not be more wrong. 

In my most recent internship, on a technically-focused team at a cybersecurity company, only three of my 28 teammates were women. My mentor was a man, my bosses were men, and everyone I directly interfaced with was a man. The adjustment was difficult. I had to adjust to the masculine energy of the team and the company (and the cybersecurity industry as a whole) in a way that was distinctly exhausting. I value the experience and the company was a great fit, but by the end of the summer, I still felt I didn't quite belong. 

Though undergraduate computer science classes are somewhat approaching a gender equilibrium (although this cannot be said for my cybersecurity classes), this has yet to be reflected in the workplace. The Zuck's own company is 66% male employees. Male bosses and coworkers, though often well-intentioned, still often slip into stereotyping and microaggressions. The experiences of one tech alum, Kelley Greene, described in [this](https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-worked-tech-industry-15-214617926.html) article, are not unfamiliar. I've been talked down to in job interviews, overlooked in meetings, criticized for traits my male colleagues have been praised for - at my last performance review, I was told I was *too* ambitious, *too* hardworking, and needed ensure my goals were more reasonable, never mind that I achieved every single one. Somehow I doubt any of the male interns were told the same.

[This article](https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-worked-tech-industry-15-214617926.html) is interesting because it provides a narrative of a womanâ€™s 15-year journey in the tech industry, highlighting the persistent challenges and systemic issues that continue to affect women in tech. Despite ongoing discussions about diversity and inclusion, the narrative highlights that significant barriers remain.
